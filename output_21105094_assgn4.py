                    Ques 3
Enter first number: 24
Enter second number(should be non-zero): -8
Result :- 
 Quoteint is:  -3
 Remiander is:  0
           Part a)
Function is callable.
           Part b)
Remainder is zero but Quotient is non zero.
           Part c)
New Result :-
 (-3, 0, 4, 5, 6)
Values greater than 4 are:
 (5, 6)
           Part d)
After converting to Set datatype:
 {5, 6}
           Part e)
Immutable Set:
 frozenset({5, 6})
           Part f)
Largest value in the set:  6
Hash value of the largest value in the set: 6
